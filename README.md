# AI-Powered Product Search Engine with RAG
## Enterprise Product Discovery Platform

---

# Overview

- Revolutionary product search solution
- Advanced AI/ML technology stack
- Intelligent query understanding
- Hybrid search capabilities
- Real-time learning & adaptation

---

# Why This Matters? 🎯
  Solving the "Unknown Product Search" Challenge
  The Enhanced Search Service specifically addresses one of e-commerce's most significant challenges: helping users find products when they have only a conceptual understanding but don't know exact names or specifications. This capability transforms vague, contextual queries into precise product recommendations.

- **Customer Experience**
  - Natural language understanding
  - Context-aware results
  - Intelligent recommendations

- **Business Impact**
  - Increased conversion rates
  - Reduced search abandonment
  - Better product discovery

- **Technical Innovation**
  - State-of-the-art AI models
  - Scalable architecture
  - Continuous learning

# System Architecture

## Core Components

### 1. API Service (Go)
- Configuration management via REST API
- MongoDB for config persistence
- Redis for job queue management
- S3 integration for CSV storage
- Real-time status updates
- Versioning support

### 2. Training Service (Python)
- Processes jobs from Redis queue
- Reads product data from S3
- Generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers
- Stores vectors in Qdrant
- Supports incremental updates
- Version-aware training

### 3. Search Service (Python)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation
- Hybrid vector search with Qdrant
- LLM-powered query expansion
- Multi-level caching system
- Version-specific searches
